This AI uses architectural styles to identify buildings and recognize what time period it is from. It runs using a re-trained resnet-18 convolutional model allowing it to identify shapes in buildings. It was trained using a dataset of architectural styles re-sorted using code into time periods. The data was received from kaggle, a dataset website. The photos contained in the dataset consist of buildings sorted into subfolders of architectural styles. Although it is still confused about some buildings now, with more time, training and data, this AI will be able to fully recognize architectural styles.
