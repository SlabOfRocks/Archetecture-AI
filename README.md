# Archetecture-AI
My AI can look at the image of a building and tell you from what time period it is from, it works on modern, postmodern, ancient and more recent but non-Modern buildings. This AI will allow people less experienced in buildings to be able to figure out how old a building might be without much in-depth research. This can help tourists, agents surveying buildings or just curious people.
